ALS collaborative filtering using Spark TensorFrame

## Tutorial:
### Tensorflow
Please see image_classification.ipynb notebook and [Esther's Github Repo](https://www.github.com/esther3587/tensorflow) to learn about how to use tensorflow library.

### Spark
Please go to [Databricks](https://databricks.com) and sign up for free account. Then start running Spark with their tutorial.

### Run Tensorflow on Databricks with single node
MNIST.ipynb has the code for simple MNIST digit recognition project using Tensorflow library. I tested and it can be run successfully on Databricks.
